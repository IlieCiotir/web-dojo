      <p>Shortly after you finish setting up the the table the other students arrive and the mentors <b>transition</b> a large hot pizza for everyone.</p>
      <p>While you are eating the head mentor stands up and asks for your attention.</p>   
      <p class="rework">-I would like to welcome you all to this dojo. Today you will take the first steps towards becoming a <b>Web Samurai</b> and I want you to know that you will not be alone. The mentors will all be here to help you but most importantly your fellow students will be with you. So, don't be shy, introduce yourselves to everyone.</p>
      <p>After that you spent the rest of the day getting to konw the mentors and the other students. Later after dinner you decide it's best to go to bed and rest for the training session early tomorrow morning.</p>
