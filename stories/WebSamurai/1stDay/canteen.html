      <p>One of the mentors is waiting at the entrance of the canteen.</p>
      <p>-I was wondering when one of you was going to show up. Since you're the first you'll have to help me set the table for lunch.<br/>
        First I want you to take the tablecloth from the <b>images</b> folder and put it on the table, and make sure it doesn't repeat!. After that take some plates and put as many of them on the table as possible but make sure there's at least a 10 pixels <b>margin</b> between them</p>   
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>As you reach for the tablecloth you hear a voice coming from the <b>W3C Standards Book</b> telling you to open it to the <b>background</b> page. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp" target="_wrc_css_background">Open the book</a></p>
