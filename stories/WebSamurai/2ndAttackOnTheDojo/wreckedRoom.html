    	<p>You are woken up in the middle of the night by a terrible noise.</p>
    	<p>Looking around you see that the entire room is ravaged. Some of the ceiling beams have fallen and are now blocking the door. The door itself is a mess and through it you can see the burning hallway.</p>
    	<p>On the other side a mentor is looking at you.</p>
    	<p>-You survived, the dojo is under attack. You will have to get yourself out, the door is badly damaged, you'll have to fix it. I must go help the others. If you have quetions ask them out loud and I will respond. Oh and you better make yourself a weapon, sharpen one of the beams and make a spear.</p>
    	<p>The mentor leaves in the direction of the canteen.</p>
    	<p>You start moving the fallen beams out of the way and repair the broken door.</p>
