          <h2>Realm 101</h2>
          <p>
            Hosted in the memory of an ancient quantum computer <b>Ream 101</b> is a land of mythical beasts and hidden knowledge.
            <br/>
            From the loud <b>Code monkeys of Scratch</b> to the <b>Photoshop Mages</b> and the <b>Hermits of Java</b> all the creatures living in it are using powerfull skills to shape and create the world around them.
            <br/>
            Out of all the inhabitans of <b>Realm 101</b> though, none is more powerfull than the wise <b>Web Samurai</b>.
            <br/>
            Riding horses of pure <b>HTML</b> breed, wearing enchanted <b>CSS</b> battle armor and wielding mighty <b>Javascript</b> swords the <b>Web Samurai</b> are 101's builders and peacekeepers.
            <br/>
            Using their arcane knowledge and the works of the other inhabitants they create the <b>Websites of 101</b>, magical portals used by everyone to travel in this world.
            <br/>
            But such power does not come without sacrifices, for one to become a Web Samuray he/she must leave their family and join a Coder Dojo, where the ancient knowledge is taught by all-knowing <b>Mentors</b>.
            <br/>
            And that is exactly what you planned to do after visiting the <b>Oracle of Pseudorandom</b>. It told you that you have been chosen to be one of the great <b>Web Samurai</b> heroes of <b>Realm 101</b>, and ever since you have spent all your free time studying what you could find about the <b>Web Samurai</b> in the library of the <b>Code Academy</b>.
